* Ku Shang Yi
* Mikhil Anand

## Audience
* General Internet users
* People with sight disabilities (e.g long-sighted)

## Problems
* There’s too much content to read in T&C
* It may be difficult to read content in small print, especially for people with eyesight problems
* People may miss out on important information if they do not read T&Cs or fine print on advertisements etc.
* https://tosdr.org/ - Terms of Service Didn’t Read; An open source project that aims to make terms and conditions simpler for internet users to read

## Solution
* A program that extracts relevant information from T&C and fine print

## Assumptions
* People don’t read the terms and conditions
* People want/need to read the terms and conditions
* The information pulled out from the fine print is important

## Unique Selling Point
* Other software with similar functions require manual review and input of T&C, or requires users to open the T&C page and search for a specific phrase in the T&C
* We will be developing a chrome extension that automatically finds the T&C, and automatically summarises the key points before displaying them to the user

## Competitors
* Terms of Services Didn’t Read
* TOSback.org
* Clickwrapped
* Terms and Conditions Checker (Chrome Extension)
